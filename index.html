        <h2>In the Footprint of the Crocodile Man:Contemporary Art of the Sepik River, Papua New Guinea</h2>
        The Sepik River of Papua New Guinea is one of the largest river systems
        in the world, extraordinarily beautiful, but seldom visited. It is here
        that the Iatmul people, who live along its banks, have created internationally
        renowned works of art primarily inspired by stories of the majestic crocodile
        as the primordial creator.<br>
        This unique exhibition will showcase the most comprehensive collection of contemporary
        Sepik art in North America for the first time. In addition to highlighting the
        exquisite carvings of Papua New Guinea’s latmul people, the exhibition will delve
        into their economic, cultural, and spiritual connections to the river system,
        rawing urgent attention to the logging and mining operations that pose environmental
        threats to the region.
